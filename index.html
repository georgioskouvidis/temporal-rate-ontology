                <h3>Detailed Explanation</h3>
                <p>General Relativity successfully represents gravitational phenomena through spacetime geometry, but this representational framework is often interpreted as an ontological account of what fundamentally exists. TRO challenges this interpretive move by distinguishing between what theories <em>represent</em> and what they reveal about <em>ontology</em>.</p>
                
                <p>The framework begins from a minimal ontological commitment: ordered temporal succession—the capacity for states to differ in an ordered manner. This is treated as primitive, not derived from or defined within a pre-existing temporal dimension. From this foundation, spatial and geometric structures emerge as representational devices that encode how multiple local temporal rates can be consistently coordinated.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key applications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gravitation:</strong> Gravitational time dilation becomes the primary physical effect, with geometric curvature serving as a derived representation</li>
                    <li><strong>Black holes:</strong> Understood as limits of temporal rate compatibility rather than purely geometric singularities</li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmology:</strong> Evolution reflects changes in global temporal coherence rather than expansion of fundamental space</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantum mechanics:</strong> Asymmetric treatment of time aligns naturally with temporal primacy</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantum gravity:</strong> The "problem of time" dissolves when time need not emerge from geometry to be fundamental</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> TRO is empirically equivalent to standard General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Its value lies in <strong>conceptual clarification</strong> and <strong>interpretive coherence</strong> rather than in new empirical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does it mean to "dissolve" rather than "solve" the problem of time?</h3>
                    <p>The problem of time in quantum gravity asks how time can be recovered from formalisms (like the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) that appear timeless. Most approaches try to "solve" this by deriving time from quantum-geometric structures. TRO instead "dissolves" the problem by questioning the assumption that time must emerge from geometry. If temporal succession is ontologically prior to geometry, then its absence from geometric formalisms isn't paradoxical—it's expected. The problem arises from conflating representational structure with ontological ground, not from physics itself.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is TRO a new physical theory?</h3>
                    <p>No. TRO is an <strong>interpretive framework</strong> for existing theories, not a replacement for them. It introduces no new dynamics, makes no new empirical predictions, and is empirically equivalent to standard General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Its contribution is philosophical: clarifying the distinction between representational structure and ontological commitment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does TRO differ from other non-geometric approaches?</h3>
                    <p>Many foundational approaches (causal sets, process ontologies, informational frameworks) reject geometric fundamentality. TRO's distinctive claim is that these alternatives implicitly presuppose temporal ordering. By making this presupposition explicit, TRO argues for temporal succession as a minimally committal primitive.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does TRO solve the measurement problem or other foundational puzzles?</h3>
                    <p>No. TRO does not resolve the measurement problem, derive the Born rule, or solve other technical foundational problems. It offers ontological interpretation and conceptual clarification, showing how quantum mechanics' temporal asymmetry and spatial non-locality may be understood within a temporally grounded ontology.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about quantum gravity?</h3>
                    <p>TRO's implications for quantum gravity are methodological rather than technical. It suggests that attempts to "geometrize time" or eliminate temporal asymmetry may be addressing a representational artifact rather than a fundamental problem. However, TRO does not provide a quantum gravity formalism.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does temporal rate relate to proper time in GR?</h3>
                    <p>In standard GR, the metric component g₀₀ governs gravitational time dilation. TRO interprets this as encoding local temporal rate: ρ(x) ≈ √(-g₀₀). When identified everywhere with the metric, TRO is empirically equivalent to GR. The difference is interpretive: TRO treats temporal rate as ontologically primitive and geometry as its representation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can TRO be empirically tested?</h3>
                    <p>If temporal rate is identified with √(-g₀₀), TRO is empirically equivalent to GR and cannot be distinguished by experiment. If temporal rate were given independent structure, potential deviations might appear in precision clock experiments or quantum interferometry in gravitational fields. However, current work treats TRO as an interpretive framework rather than proposing such modifications.</p>
